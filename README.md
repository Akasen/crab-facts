This is a little project I'm working on as a bit of a gag for a friend of mine. I'm confident said friend won't notice this repository because they aren't a programmer and aren't likely to check Github.

At the moment of writing, the front end of this project is mostly done for the purposes of just testing things. Later on I will go out of my way to make it responsive and brush up the design.

There's some stuff hard coded in a list to generate "facts", but I'm wanting to make a backend where one can login as an admin and add more facts to a database and such.

My aim is to do all this with the MERN stack, however there may be a possibility I might try and take the front end I have and slap that onto Django. Expect "crab-facts-django" if that's the case.
