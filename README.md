This is a little project I'm working on as a bit of a gag for a friend of mine. I'm confident said friend won't notice this repository because they aren't a programmer and aren't likely to check Github.

At the moment of writing, the front end of this project is mostly done for the purposes of just testing things. Later on I will go out of my way to make it responsive and brush up the design.

There's some stuff hard coded in a list to generate "facts", but I'm wanting to make a backend where one can login as an admin and add more facts to a database and such.

My aim is to do all this with the MERN stack, however there may be a possibility I might try and take the front end I have and slap that onto Django. Expect "crab-facts-django" if that's the case.

One other thing of note, I'm absolutely horrible with git. Both in experience and just sheer bad practice. If you check the history of this project, two things will stand out:

1. I've had to do commits to remove folders (thankfully not folders containing sensitive info again)
2. My first commit messages are basically a giant "OOPS" message

I had commits relating to the client side stuff, but I flubbed up because of the way I have this all set up. I really should have seen if I could have moved the git to a new location honestly instead of losing commits and history like I did.
